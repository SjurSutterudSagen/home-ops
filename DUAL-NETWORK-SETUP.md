# Dual Network Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to configure the cluster template for a dual-network setup with high-speed direct connections between nodes for cluster traffic and separate external network interfaces for internet access.

## Overview

In a dual-network configuration:
- **External Network (`node_cidr`)**: Slower ethernet connections with internet access for management, external services, and ingress traffic
- **Cluster Network (`cluster_cidr`)**: High-speed direct connections between nodes for internal Kubernetes traffic (etcd, kubelet, pod-to-pod communication)

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: High-speed cluster network improves etcd performance, pod-to-pod communication, and storage replication
2. **Isolation**: Separates cluster traffic from external traffic for better security and performance
3. **Scalability**: Reduces congestion on the external network by offloading cluster communication

## Network Planning

### IP Address Allocation

You'll need to plan two separate network ranges:

#### External Network (`node_cidr`)
- Used for: Management access, external services, ingress traffic
- Example: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Needs: Internet gateway, DNS servers

#### Cluster Network (`cluster_cidr`)
- Used for: Kubernetes API, etcd, kubelet, pod-to-pod communication, load balancer services
- Example: `10.0.0.0/24`
- Needs: High-speed direct connections between nodes (no internet required)

### Example Configuration

For a 3-node cluster:

**External Network (192.168.1.0/24):**
- Gateway: `192.168.1.1`
- Node 1: `192.168.1.10`
- Node 2: `192.168.1.11`
- Node 3: `192.168.1.12`

**Cluster Network (10.0.0.0/24):**
- Node 1: `10.0.0.10`
- Node 2: `10.0.0.11`
- Node 3: `10.0.0.12`
- Kubernetes API VIP: `10.0.0.100`
- Internal Gateway: `10.0.0.101`
- DNS Gateway: `10.0.0.102`

## Configuration Files

```

### nodes.yaml

```yaml
---
nodes:
  - name: "node-1"
    address: "192.168.1.10"              # External network IP
    cluster_address: "10.0.0.10"         # Cluster network IP
    controller: true
    disk: "/dev/sda"
    mac_addr: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:01"         # External NIC MAC
    cluster_mac_addr: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:11"  # Cluster NIC MAC

    mtu: 1500                             # External network MTU
    cluster_mtu: 1500                     # Cluster network MTU (start with 1500, test before using 9000)

    schematic_id: "your-schematic-id"
    mtu: 1500
    cluster_mtu: 1500
```

## Hardware Setup

### Physical Connections

For your 3-node setup with direct connections:

1. **External Network**: Each node connects to your main switch/router via ethernet
2. **Cluster Network**: Direct high-speed connections between nodes:
   - Node 1 ‚Üî Node 2 (direct cable)
   - Node 1 ‚Üî Node 3 (direct cable)
   - Node 2 ‚Üî Node 3 (direct cable)

Alternatively, you can use a dedicated high-speed switch for the cluster network.

### Network Interface Identification

Before configuration, identify your network interfaces on each node:

```bash
# Boot from Talos ISO and run:
talosctl get links --nodes <node-ip> --insecure

# This will show you the MAC addresses of each interface
# Use these MAC addresses in your nodes.yaml configuration
```

## MTU Considerations

- **External Network**: Standard 1500 MTU for compatibility
- **Cluster Network**: Consider jumbo frames (9000 MTU) for better performance on high-speed connections

## DNS and Service Discovery

- **External DNS**: Points to external gateway IP for public services
- **Internal DNS**: Points to cluster gateway IP for internal services
- **k8s_gateway**: Runs on cluster network for internal service discovery

## Traffic Flow

### External Traffic
Internet ‚Üí Router ‚Üí External NIC ‚Üí External Gateway ‚Üí Services

### Internal Traffic
Pod ‚Üí Cluster Network ‚Üí High-speed links ‚Üí Destination Pod

### API Traffic
kubectl ‚Üí External Network ‚Üí Load Balancer ‚Üí Cluster Network ‚Üí Kubernetes API

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Interface Detection**: Ensure Cilium is configured with correct device patterns
2. **Routing**: Verify routes are correctly configured on both networks
3. **MTU**: Ensure MTU settings are consistent across the cluster network
4. **Firewall**: Verify cluster network allows all required Kubernetes ports

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check network interfaces
talosctl get links --nodes <node-ip>

# Check routes
talosctl get routes --nodes <node-ip>

# Check Cilium status
cilium status

# Check pod-to-pod connectivity
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- ping <other-pod-ip>
```

## Performance Tuning

1. **Enable jumbo frames** on cluster network (MTU 9000)
2. **Use SR-IOV** if available on your NICs
3. **Tune network buffers** for high-throughput applications
4. **Consider DPDK** for ultra-low latency requirements

## Security Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Requirements

1. **Network Isolation**:
   - Cluster network MUST NOT be routable from external networks
   - Use dedicated switches or direct cables for cluster network
   - Implement VLAN isolation if using shared infrastructure

2. **Firewall Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Example iptables rules for external interface (adapt to your firewall)
   # Block access to cluster network from external sources
   iptables -I FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -j DROP
   iptables -I FORWARD -s 10.0.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j DROP
   ```

3. **Interface Access Control**:
   - Physically secure cluster network connections
   - Use locked server racks or cabinets
   - Consider using fiber optic connections for tamper resistance

4. **Network Encryption** (Recommended for sensitive environments):
   ```yaml
   # Add to Talos machine configuration for IPSec encryption
   machine:
     network:
       kubespan:
         enabled: true
         allowDownPeerBypass: false
   ```

5. **Monitoring and Auditing**:
   - Monitor cluster network traffic for anomalies
   - Log access to cluster network interfaces
   - Set up alerts for unexpected network activity

### üîí Secure Configuration Practices

1. **Device Pattern Specification**:
   ```yaml
   # In Cilium configuration - BE SPECIFIC about interfaces
   # BAD (too permissive):
   devices: eth+ eno+

   # GOOD (specific to your cluster NICs):
   devices: eth1 eno2 enp2s0
   ```

2. **MTU Configuration**:
   - Start with standard MTU (1500) and test before enabling jumbo frames
   - Ensure all network infrastructure supports chosen MTU
   - Test end-to-end connectivity before production deployment

3. **Route Table Isolation** (Advanced):
   ```bash
   # Consider using policy-based routing for additional isolation
   ip rule add from 10.0.0.0/24 table 100
   ip route add default via 10.0.0.1 table 100
   ```

### üö® Security Warnings

**WARNING**: The cluster network carries sensitive traffic including:
- Kubernetes API communication
- etcd cluster data
- Pod-to-pod communication
- Secret and certificate data

**CRITICAL**: Never expose cluster network interfaces to untrusted networks or the internet.

**IMPORTANT**: Regularly audit network configurations and access controls.
